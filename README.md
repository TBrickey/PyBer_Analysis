# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5: PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of Analysis

In this project, we’ve used Python, Pandas and Matplotlib to create a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results

The Urban city type had much larger riders, drivers and total fares compared to Suburban and Rural city types. Urban total fares are 2 times and 9 times greater than Suburban and Rural city types, respectively. This can be seen in the following table and graph.
