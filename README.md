# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5: PyBer with Matplotlib

## Overview of Analysis

In this project, we’ve used Python, Pandas and Matplotlib to create a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results

The Urban city type had a much larger total riders, drivers and fares compared to Suburban and Rural city types. Urban total fares are 2 times and 9 times greater than Suburban and Rural city types, respectively. This can be seen in the following table and graph.

## Summary

Based on the results, there are several recommendations I’d make. We could discount rates in Suburban and Rural city types by increasing usage. The fares are on average higher and giving a 1 time or small discount could increase rides and hopefully increase repeat customers. We could work with local entertainment businesses, such as wineries, breweries, and venues to see if there’s an opportunity to cross advertise and increase riders traveling from Urban to Rural areas and vice versa. Promotions could include discounts or a free drink with proof of our downloaded app.
